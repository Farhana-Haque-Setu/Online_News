            <p>Tonga’s sleepy capital Nuku’alofa was buzzing last week as leaders from across the Pacific region descended upon it for the annual Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) meeting.</p>
            <p>Every so often, a police escort would speed through its streets, sirens blaring. On the bonnet of the cars, small flags identified the foreign delegations. China and Taiwan were visible, as well as the Union Jack and the United Nations.</p>
            <p>All of them only participated as dialogue partners or observers. But they made a lot of noise. Their security detail was bigger than those of most of the 18 PIF members, save perhaps New Zealand and Australia. Tonga’s Royal Palace looked understated in comparison with only a sole guard looking after the King, according to sources.</p>

                <p>Throughout the week, diplomats called the meeting fascinating - but the underlying concern is that the interest by these delegations is not necessarily in line with what PIF leaders or its people want.</p>
                <p>The PIF is made up of 18 members - mostly Pacific Island nations as well as Australia and New Zealand - but delegations from across the world also attend, keen to play a role in the region, which is assuming greater geopolitical significance.The big players are no longer just Australia and the US. China is a rising power in the Pacific and one that causes ructions.</p>

            <p>When a notorious Russian assassin and an American newspaper correspondent boarded separate planes in Turkey on Thursday, it marked the culmination of a secretive, dramatic prisoner swap deal between Russia and the West that was years in the making</p>
            <p>The origins of this deal, which involved two dozen prisoners, can be traced back to 2022. But behind-the-scenes negotiations between Russia, the US and four European countries ramped up earlier this year before intensifying in recent weeks as a final agreement came into view for all sides.</p>

                <p>Those negotiations were at times feverish and testing. They also came as US-Russia tensions soared over the Ukraine war. "It was the culmination of many rounds of complex, painstaking negotiations over many, many months," Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser who played a critical role in the deal, said shortly after the exchange.</p>
